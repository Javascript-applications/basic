## How does JavaScript work?

https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-javascript#:~:text=JavaScript's%20most%20popular%20use%20is,the%20internet%20much%20more%20enjoyable.

## What is Javascript 

1. It is a high level language (it's machine independand)
2. It is light weight.
3. It's an Interpreted prog. lanuage.
   (It's means, it is a single thrade language)

##  Compilers vs. Interpreters

- Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the program runs.

- Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs. 

## Compilers vs. Interpreters: Advantages and Disadvantages

- A compiler takes in the entire program and requires a lot of time to analyze the source code. Whereas the interpreter takes a single line of code and very little time to analyze it.

- Compiled code runs faster, while interpreted code runs slower.

- A compiler displays all errors after compilation. If your code has mistakes, it will not compile. But the interpreter displays errors of each line one by one.

4. Javascript has object-oriented capabilities.
5. Javascript is an untyped language.
6. It is a case sensitive. ex -  "hello" and "Hello" two different words.

* JavaScript is a client side scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features  
   on web pages. and It create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. and It is use to intraction and to add functionalites on web pages.

* Without any additional libraries javascript is also called as "vanilla javascript". Which helps to making interactive web pages. interpreted and executed on client machine. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

## How do you add JavaScript to your page?

1. Internal JavaScript
2. Internal JavaScript

Internal JavaScript - 
---------------------

You can add script tag in head tag or body tag

<script type="text/javascript">
  // JavaScript goes here
</script>

External JavaScript - 
----------------------

1. First, create a new file in the same directory as your sample HTML file. Call it script.js â€” make sure it has that .js filename extension, as that's how it is recognized as JavaScript.

2. Replace your current <script> element with the following HTML

<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
